# My Circuit Learning Log

## 🔹 Week 1 - CircuitJS


- Started learning **CircuitJS** using the [Spoken Tutorial](https://spoken-tutorial.org/tutorial-search/?search_foss=CircuitJS&search_language) platform, as recommended by our HOD sir.
- Learned how to create a basic **LED blinking circuit** using simulation.

### ⚙️ Topic: Series and Parallel Resistance

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand how to connect resistors in **series** and **parallel** circuits.
2. Observe how **voltage** and **current** behave in each configuration.

**Experiment Setup:**
- **Circuit Description:**  
  Three resistors — **10kΩ**, **20kΩ**, and **30kΩ** — were connected in **series** with a **100V DC source** and an **ammeter**.

**Observations:**
- The **current (I)** through each resistor is the same: **1.667 mA**
- The **voltage (V)** across each resistor is different:
  - 30kΩ → **50V**
  - 20kΩ → **33.3V**
  - 10kΩ → **16.7V**

- Understood the concept of current flow through a resistor.
- Simulated logic gates such as AND and OR using CircuitJS.
- Explored some ready-made circuits such as potentiometer, rectifiers, multivibrators (astable, bistable, monostable), and transistors.
- Observed their working and waveform characteristics by varying simulation speed and current flow.


## 🔹 Week 2 - EasyEDA
- Designed a basic PCB for a 555 timer
- Added a capacitor and resistor
