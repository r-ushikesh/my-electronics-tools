# My Circuit Learning Log

## ðŸ”¹ Week 1 - CircuitJS

## ðŸ”¹ Week 1 - CircuitJS

- Started learning CircuitJS using the [Spoken Tutorial](https://spoken-tutorial.org/tutorial-search/?search_foss=CircuitJS&search_language) platform, as recommended by our HOD sir.
- Learned how to create a basic LED blinking circuit.
- Understood the concept of current flow through a resistor.
- Simulated logic gates such as AND and OR using CircuitJS.
- Explored some ready-made circuits such as potentiometer, rectifiers, multivibrators (astable, bistable, monostable), and transistors.
- Observed their working and waveform characteristics by varying simulation speed and current flow.


## ðŸ”¹ Week 2 - EasyEDA
- Designed a basic PCB for a 555 timer
- Added a capacitor and resistor
